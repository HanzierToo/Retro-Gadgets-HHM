## Handheld Minesweeper

This is the repo for Handheld Minesweeper written in Lua for the game [Retro Gadgets](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730260/Retro_Gadgets/). It's an attempt at recreating the Windows XP Minesweeper experience in a handheld form given limitations such as limited input and a forced cursor to select desired tiles. It is very poorly written and incredibly unoptimized, but these were not the priorities when I wrote this as a side project/hobby. *Note that this game **cannot** be run without the game Retro Gadgets, of which this gadget exists with sound effects and design in the [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2897839440).*
